## Jero\-Secure 1\.0


</div>

### Description

Jero-Secure 1.0 is totally original code written by myself to mimic basically what Sub-Secure does since I didn't want to buy it for $50. It first hides the desktop icons, then the system bar and minimizes all windows except for the Secure form. It has all buttons disabled (ctrl-alt-del, alt-tab, alt-f4) plus you can't move your mouse out of the form onto the desktop for security precautions. I'm still working on trying to have it still work after computer is restarted without password input but that will come later. Good code to lock un-wanted visitors out of your computer or learn some interesting API's. Please vote if you like it! ***Password is "PASSWORD"***
